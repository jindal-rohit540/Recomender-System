# Business Value 
This project aims to build a recomender system, which predicts (ratings) what the user will rate a particular item based on various techniques. Different Techniques for different business need and constraints.



# Overview : 
Recommender system has the ability to predict whether a particular user would prefer an item or not based on the user's profile. Recommender systems are beneficial to both service providers and users. They reduce transaction costs of finding and selecting items in an online shopping environment. 



# Research Flow

*  Starting from literature survey of various ranking algorithms including Hackerrank, reddit and google page rank algorithm 
*  Then moving to Machine Learning Techniques and exploring their short comings 
*  Then moving to Collaborative filtering techniques 
*  Finally implementing Matrix Factorisation using Deep Learning


# Flow of Project. 

## 1. Non Personalised Recomender Systems 
* Hacker Rank Ranking ALgorithm 
* Reddit post rank Algorithm 
* Ratings - Problem & Solution using Wilson Interval

## 2. Machine learning approach 
*  Markov page rank algorithm by Google
*  Evaluating rankings (Business Wise)


## 3. Collaborative Filtering 
*  User User Collaborative Filtering 
    * Preprocessing , Implementing the algorithm, Evaluating the error and benchmarking against standard MSE against 20M movie lens dataset

*  Item - Item Collaborative Filtering
